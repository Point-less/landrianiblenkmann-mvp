# Use AGENTS.md

- On any new mission or repo, look for `AGENTS.md` or `agents.md` in the workspace root.
- If it exists, read it and treat its instructions as project rules:
  - Below system/platform rules, above ad-hoc user prompts.
- Re-check `AGENTS.md` when switching subprojects or starting large tasks.
- If missing or unreadable, say so and ask the user to create or share it.
